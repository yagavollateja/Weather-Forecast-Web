# Whether-Website
🌤️ Weather Forecast Web App using React.js
I created a responsive weather website using React.js that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city across the globe. The app fetches data from a free weather API (OpenWeatherMap) and displays details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

🔹 Features:

Search functionality for any city worldwide 🌍

Real-time weather updates using API integration ⛅

Clean and responsive UI with React components 🎨

Error handling for invalid city inputs ❌

Dynamic background/images based on weather condition 🌈

🔹 Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, CSS (or Tailwind/Bootstrap)

API: OpenWeatherMap API

This project helped me strengthen my React.js skills, particularly in state management, API integration, and responsive design. 🚀
